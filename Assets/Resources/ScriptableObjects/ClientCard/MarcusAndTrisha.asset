  - "Amazing, it looks like it did when we bought it. My wife purchased this as a
    gift for my son\u2019s fifth birthday. He loved it, and carried it everywhere.
    Unfortunately, shortly after his birthday we were hit by a drunk driver. Our
    son, he didn\u2019t make it. So this plushie is one of the last few things we
    have left. We cannot express how grateful we are for your help. \r\n"
