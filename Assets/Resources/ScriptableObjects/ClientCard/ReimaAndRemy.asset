  - 'It looks amazing! I bought this for Remy right before she came out to her parents.
    She was so nervous, in fact when it came time, she just kind of stood there babbling.
    I gave her this plushie half-way through and everything just kind of clicked.
    We kind of see it as an inside joke now, but I know this fluffy little guy means
    a lot to her. Thank you so much!
