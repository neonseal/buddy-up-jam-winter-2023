    - "Hello, I saw your ad in the newspaper and was wondering if you could help
      me?\t"

      experienced its fair share of wear and tear."
    - "The darn thing belonged to my wife and she was always going on about getting

    sentences:
    - "Wow, I can\u2019t believe it, the thing looks exactly as it did all those
      years ago. My wife loved plushies, so naturally when she saw this little guy
      at the fair, there was no question"
    - "Of course, the clerk wouldn\u2019t just let me buy the thing, but made me
      play for it. It may have cost me an arm and a leg, but she absolutely loved
      it. Thank you for all of your help. "
