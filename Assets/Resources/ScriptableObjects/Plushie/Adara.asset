    sentences:
    - "Hello, I was hoping you could take a look at my plushie. I\u2019ve had her
      now for a few years so the stuffing is pretty worn down."
    - "On top of that, I accidently ripped one of the seams. I know it seems small,
      but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to get worse. Do you think you can fix
      it?"
  resolutionDialogue:
    name: Adara
    sentences:
    - "It looks just like new, thank you! I\u2019m not a huge plushie fan, but when
      I was younger I was in the hospital for a few months and my mother gave this
      to me as a get well present."
    - "Since then, it\u2019s traveled along with me and\u2026 well it means the world
      to me. Thank you so much for your help."
