  issueDialogue:
    name: Tyr
    sentences:
    - Hi, my neighbor was telling me that you repaired plushies. I was hoping you
      could take a look at this guy.
    - "He\u2019s been through a lot, five years in the military to be exact. Any
      help you could provide would be greatly appreciated."
  resolutionDialogue:
    name: Tyr
    sentences:
    - "You\u2019re probably curious as to why a hardened Veteran like myself is carrying
      around this fluffy little guy, right?"
    - "It was a gift actually, from a little girl I\u2019d helped. Her village had
      flooded and somehow she was separated from her family. It took two days, but
      we managed to track them down. She was so grateful she gave me her favorite
      plushie."
    - "I, of course, tried to decline, but she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.
      Over the years I\u2019ve grown quite fond of the little thing. So, thank you
      for helping me out."
