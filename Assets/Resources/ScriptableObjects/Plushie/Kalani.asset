    - "Hello, I heard about your shop from one of the mother\u2019s at school."
    - "I\u2019m not sure if you can help, but I\u2019d greatly appreciate it if you
      could take a look. As you can see from the large rip and missing stuffing it\u2019s
      not going to be easy."
  resolutionDialogue:

    sentences:
    - "You did it\u2026 It looks fantastic! She\u2019ll never even know."
    - This was all my fault, my daughter loves that thing so as you can imagine it
      gets its fair amount of use.
    - Last night, I told her to leave it out so I could throw it in the wash, but
      then the phone rang and I just kind of got side tracked. The next thing I knew,
      our dog Rover was chomping down.
    - Thankfully you were able to save it.
