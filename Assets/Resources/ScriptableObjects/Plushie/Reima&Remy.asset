    - Hello, my girlfriend and I just moved here from out of state and happened to
      see one of your fliers.
    - "During our move, I may have accidentally damaged one of Remy\u2019s favorite
      plushies. Usually it wouldn\u2019t matter, we could just buy a replacement,
      but this one is special. "
    - Do you think you could take a look?
