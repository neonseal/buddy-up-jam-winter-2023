    sentences:
    - Hello, my girlfriend and I just moved here from out of state and happened to
      see one of your fliers.
    - "During our move, I may have accidentally damaged one of Remy\u2019s favorite
      plushies. Usually it wouldn\u2019t matter, we could just buy a replacement,
      but this one is special. "
    - Do you think you could take a look?

    - It looks amazing!
    - I bought this for Remy right before she came out to her parents. She was so
      nervous, in fact when it came time, she just kind of stood there babbling.
    - I gave her this plushie half-way through and everything just kind of clicked.
      We kind of see it as an inside joke now, but I know this fluffy little guy
      means a lot to her.

    - Thank you so much!
