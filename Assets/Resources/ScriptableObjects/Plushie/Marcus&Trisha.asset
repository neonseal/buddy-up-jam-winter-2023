    sentences:
    - "Amazing, it looks like it did when we bought it. My wife purchased this as
      a gift for my son\u2019s fifth birthday."
    - He loved it, and carried it everywhere. Unfortunately, shortly after his birthday
      we were hit by a drunk driver.
    - "Our son\u2026 he didn\u2019t make it, so this plushie\u2026 it\u2019s one
      of the last few things we have left. We cannot express how grateful we are
      for your help."
